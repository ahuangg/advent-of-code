All of the instructions have been jumbled up!</p>\n","<p>It seems like the goal of the program is just to <em>multiply some numbers</em>. It does that with instructions like <code>mul(X,Y)</code>, where <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are each 1-3 digit numbers. For instance, <code>mul(44,46)</code> multiplies <code>44</code> by <code>46</code> to get a result of <code>2024</code>. Similarly, <code>mul(123,4)</code> would multiply <code>123</code> by <code>4</code>.</p>\n","<p>However, because the program's memory has been corrupted, there are also many invalid characters that should be <em>ignored</em>, even if they look like part of a <code>mul</code> instruction. Sequences like <code>mul(4*</code>, <code>mul(6,9!</code>, <code>?(12,34)</code>, or <code>mul ( 2 , 4 )</code> do <em>nothing</em>.</p>\n","<p>For example, consider the following section of corrupted memory:</p>\n","<pre><code>x<em>mul(2,4)</em>%&amp;mul[3,7]!@^do_not_<em>mul(5,5)</em>+mul(32,64]then(<em>mul(11,8)mul(8,5)</em>)</code></pre>\n","<p>Only the four highlighted sections are real <code>mul</code> instructions. Adding up the result of each instruction produces <code><em>161</em></code> (<code>2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5</code>).</p>\n","<p>Scan the corrupted memory for uncorrupted <code>mul</code> instructions. <em>What do you get if you add up all of the results of the multiplications?</em></p>\n","</article>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":46,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["167650499"]},"execution_count":46,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["import re\n","def solution(input):\n","    pattern = r'mul\\((\\d{1,3}),(\\d{1,3})\\)'\n","    result = 0\n","    \n","    for line in input:\n","        matches = re.findall(pattern, str(line))\n","        for num1, num2 in matches:\n","            result += int(num1) * int(num2)\n","    \n","    \n","    return result\n","\n","input = parse_input('input1.txt')\n","solution(input)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":45,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["167650499"]},"execution_count":45,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Submission\n","167650499"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<article class=\"day-desc\"><h2 id=\"part2\">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>As you scan through the corrupted memory, you notice that some of the conditional statements are also still intact.
